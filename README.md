# MATH3024 - Forest Fire Simulator

Before you are able to run the simulator you will first need to install the required packages. This can be done by going into the Q# folder and running the following command,

	pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Once these packages have been installed the simulator can be run. An example, simulator can be run by using the following command,

	python3 ./Project/Q3/main.py

from the root directory. The example simulation analysis code can be run using

	python3 ./Project/Q3/run_simulation_threaded.py

This will run a number of simulation concurrently in order to reduce the total time needed to perform all the simulations.
